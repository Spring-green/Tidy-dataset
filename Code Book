# Tidy dataset
The run_analysis.R script prepares the data and created 2 datasets based on the following steps:
A.Preparing data was done by downloading the dataset and reading data(8 datasets) into 8 data frames as following:
features <- features.txt - The features are from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt -List of activities 
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt - includes 9 out of 30 volunteer subjects 
x_test <- test/X_test.txt - includes recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt - includes test data of activitiesâ€™code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt - includes train data of 21 out of 30 volunteer subjects 
x_train <- test/X_train.txt - includes recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt - includes train data of activitiesâ€™code labels

B. Analysing the data
1. Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
X : created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y : created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject: created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
XY_merge: created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
   TidyData: created by subsetting XY_merge, selecting:  subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4. Creating appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   code column in TidyData renamed into activities
   Acc renamed into Accelerometer
   Gyro renamed into Gyroscope
   BodyBody renamed into Body
   Mag renamed into Magnitude
   All start with character f renamed into Frequency
   All start with character t renamed into Time

5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from step4
MyData- created by grouping by the data on subject and activity and then sumarizing with taking the means.

- Create MyData.txt (a txt file) using write.table() using row.name=FALSE
