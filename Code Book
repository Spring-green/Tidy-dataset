# Tidy dataset
The run_analysis.R script prepares the data and created 2 datasets based on the 5 steps described in Readme.txt on the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project of Coursera.
A.	Preparing data:
-	Download the dataset under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset
-	Reading data into R and assign each data to variables
features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns 
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns 
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column 
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns 
contains recorded features test data
y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns 
contains test data of activities’code labels
subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column 
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns 
contains recorded features train data
y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns 
contains train data of activities’code labels

1.	Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) : created ed by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) : created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) : created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
XY_merge (10299 rows, 563 column) : created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
            TidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns): created by subsetting XY_merge, including only columns:  subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3.	Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the TidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4.	Creating appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
code column in TidyData renamed into activities
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

5.	Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from step4
MyData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.

- Create MyData.txt (a txt file) using write.table() using row.name=FALSE
